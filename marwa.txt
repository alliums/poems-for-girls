I’m sorry in advance for coming off as a freak, and most likely me telling you this will blow whatever chance I could have, whether by making you unmatch me or because I’ll have humiliated myself before ever speaking to you, but I wanted to say that I didn’t know what an indelible mark someone’s eyes could leave on someone else’s soul even despite being pixelated by the lens of a camera and server compression, but that I know now, because of you, and that your eyes left that mark on my soul, and if I ever do something significant in my life I will name it Marwa, and even if I say otherwise it will be because of nothing other than you.
